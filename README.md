# UAV-orchestrator
## Overview
The UAV-orchestrator undetakes the task to orchestrate a swarm of UAVs to wirelessly charge a group of IoT devices (e.g., sensors) through wireless power transfer technology. The orchestration process is aimed at delivering the maximum amount of energy to the IoT devices, by taking into account the energy constraints of the UAVs.

This repository contains the code for simulating a part of the paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10275044. In the paper, the modeling of the system is thoroughly discussed.

Also, a GUI is included ([emulator_dashboard.py](https://github.com/wcipAUTH/UAV-orchestrator/blob/main/emulator_dashboard.py)), which visualises the orchestration of the UAVs into the field of interest.
